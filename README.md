# authscaffold - An example to show Loopback4 Authentication(A step-by-step tutorial)

[![LoopBack](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/raw/master/docs/site/imgs/branding/Powered-by-LoopBack-Badge-(blue)-@2x.png)](http://loopback.io/)

## Introduction
This example tutorial is created for the beginners or new users which are using Loopback4, and not able to configure the suthentication and authorization using `@loopback/authentication`.
As of now this example tutorial consost of single model named users, to demonstrate the authentication process. Here in this example I have user jwtAuthenticationStrategy to process authentication.

## Tutorial flow
I have divided the authentication process in to fewer steps. Which I will discuss in next commit.

## Known bugs
-[1] Can not add unique key attribute/constraint to the column(currently using mongodb)
